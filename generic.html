						<p> My journey began during lockdown when I attended html lessons my friend was hosting. I quickly realized that <strong>coding is really fun!</strong>
						<p> Researching careers that include coding and taking a couple of more classes to see what better fits my <strong>skills</strong>  led me to the conclusion that I would like pursue a career in data analytics. </p>
						<p> After learning come of the basics and working on a number of projects, I prepared this portfolio and am actively looking for a job.</p>
